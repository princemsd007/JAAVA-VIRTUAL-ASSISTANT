# JAAVA-VIRTUAL-ASSISTANT
The Smart Voice Assistant that we have developed J.A.A.V.A, is a voice  assistant that is developed in such a way that it provides a lot of options for its  particular user. It stands for ‘Just Another Aesthetic Voice Assistant’.  Our Assistant J.A.A.V.A comes with a lot of features like Making Phone  Calls, Scheduling Meetings and setting Appointments for the user, Gets  Directions for the users, Sending Messages, Setting Reminders, Playing  Music and various Videos and can even set alarms for users. The Assistant  can open any website in the browser, tell you the current weather or temperature  of a location, play you a song, and keep your news feed updated. The Voice  Assistant can also answer questions for the users.  The thing about our Voice Assistant is that this Assistant speaks naturally with  the user, grows along with the user and even entertains the user. By this  Assistant we aim to give users an opportunity to organise their schedules and  data in a much more effective way.  Popular Voice Assistants that we know and see people use include assistants  like Alexa, Siri and Google Assistant
